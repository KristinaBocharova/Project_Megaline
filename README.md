### Project Description

This project involves creating a machine learning model to classify mobile users into two new tariff plans offered by Megaline: **Smart** and **Ultra**. The model will analyze user behavior based on their monthly activities, such as the number of calls, messages, and data usage, to recommend the most suitable plan. The aim is to achieve a classification accuracy of at least **0.75**, ensuring that the model can make reliable predictions on unseen data.

### Methods and Libraries Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing the machine learning model and conducting data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library that provides tools for building and evaluating machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, and for tuning hyperparameters.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for visualizing data distributions, feature relationships, and performance metrics of the model.
- **NumPy**: For performing efficient numerical operations and handling large datasets.
