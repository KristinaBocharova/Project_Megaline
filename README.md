# **Develop a model for Megaline**  

## **Project Description:**  
This project involves creating a machine learning model to classify mobile users into two new tariff plans offered by Megaline: **Smart** and **Ultra**. The model will analyze user behavior based on their monthly activities, such as the number of calls, messages, and data usage, to recommend the most suitable plan. The aim is to achieve a classification accuracy of at least **0.75**, ensuring that the model can make reliable predictions on unseen data.  

## **Dataset:**  
- сalls — number of calls,
- minutes — total call duration in minutes,
- messages — number of text messages,
- mb_used — Internet traffic used in MB,
- is_ultra — plan for the current month (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0). 

## **Tools Used:**  
- Python (pandas, sklearn)
